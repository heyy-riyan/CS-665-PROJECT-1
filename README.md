# 💊 Pharma-Sync: Pharmacy Supply Management System

## Project Description

Pharma-Sync is a Pharmacy Supply Management System designed to streamline inventory tracking, order logging, and pharmacy operations using a user-friendly graphical interface. The system supports secure CRUD operations for managing medicines, suppliers, pharmacy details, and activity logs.

Targeted at offline pharmacies and small medical outlets, the application reduces manual paperwork, prevents data redundancy, and speeds up data retrieval through a MySQL-backed relational database.

The backend is built with Python (Flask) and SQLAlchemy, while the GUI leverages HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The system is hosted locally using XAMPP and runs seamlessly on Windows.
